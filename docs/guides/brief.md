**1. Product Thesis/Brief**

**Working Title:** “Ever” – A Dynamic Thought-Capture and Enrichment Platform

**Core Problem & Opportunity**  
- **Problem:** Users often capture raw ideas/notes across different apps and lose track of them; they get minimal actionable value.  
- **Opportunity:** Centralize raw thoughts in one place, then automatically extract and enrich them (tasks, structured data, insights). Over time, the enrichment pipeline improves and leverages historical data for deeper insights.

**Target Users**  
- Individuals or professionals who frequently generate ideas, tasks, or notes but lack a streamlined method to organize and utilize them.  
- Early adopters interested in automated knowledge management and productivity enhancements.

**Value Proposition**  
- **Effortless Capture:** Minimal friction to record text/voice notes.  
- **Automated Enrichment:** The system processes notes to create structured entities (tasks, topics, activities).  
- **Continuous Improvement:** As the pipeline evolves, past and future notes yield richer information without additional user overhead.

**Key Features (MVP)**  
1. **Unified Note Capture:**  
   - Quick input (text or voice).  
   - Immediate save with background processing.  

2. **Enriched Notes:**  
   - Automatic detection of keywords, context, categories.  
   - Basic “topic” or “task” hints from raw text.  

3. **Task Extraction:**  
   - Identify actionable items from raw text.  
   - Save tasks for reference, reminders, scheduling.  

4. **Timeline View (Basic):**  
   - Chronological list of notes, tasks created, or short highlights.  
   - Simple filters for date ranges, event types.  

**Future Features**  
- **Advanced Activities & Moments:**  
  - Automated logging of user-defined ‘activities’ (reading, exercise, etc.).  
  - Tracking and analytics over extended periods.  
- **Deep Enrichment:**  
  - Expanding extraction pipeline to identify relationships among notes, tasks, and other user data (e.g., events, context).  
- **Collaboration/Sharing (Longer term):**  
  - Shared spaces for teams or communities.  
- **Integrations:**  
  - Calendar, email, task management, advanced AI-based summarization.

**User Experience Principles**  
- **Low Friction:** Minimal UI steps to capture data.  
- **Transparent Processing:** Show when notes are processed, updated, or re-enriched.  
- **Clarity & Feedback:** Provide concise notifications/visual cues about new tasks or enriched information.  
- **Incremental Onboarding:** Unveil advanced features only when they add clear value.

**Success Metrics**  
- **Adoption & Retention:** Number of weekly active users, churn rate.  
- **Engagement:** Frequency of note capture, frequency of re-checking or referencing tasks.  
- **Processing Efficacy:** Percentage of notes successfully enriched, user satisfaction with enrichment quality.  
- **Expansion:** Growth in complexity and utility of the enrichment pipeline over time (e.g., types of entities extracted).

**Technical Architecture (High-Level)**  
- **Frontend:** Cross-platform (e.g., Flutter) for consistent experience across mobile/web.  
- **Backend:**  
  - **Capture Service:** Endpoint to store raw notes immediately.  
  - **Enrichment Pipeline:** Asynchronous microservice or job queue to parse, extract tasks, or generate structured data.  
  - **Core API:** Manages user accounts, notes, tasks, timeline events, etc.  
  - **Data Storage:** Postgres or equivalent for structured data; scalable object store for attachments.  

**Roadmap & Phased Rollout**  
1. **MVP Release:**  
   - Basic capture (text/voice), note storage, simple note enrichment, essential tasks extraction.  
2. **Enhanced Task Management:**  
   - Additional fields (priority, tags, due dates) plus timeline integration.  
3. **Activity Framework:**  
   - Optionally track user-defined activities from notes.  
4. **Refinement & AI Iterations:**  
   - Upgrade processing logic for more robust entity extraction and timeline analysis.  

**Conclusion**  
“Ever” aims to reduce friction in idea capture while maximizing long-term value via continuous enrichment of raw user data. The MVP focuses on enriched notes and basic task extraction, providing enough immediate utility to keep users engaged while iteratively improving backend intelligence.
