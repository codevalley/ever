# Ever App - User API Improvements

## Current Focus: User API Robustness

### 1. Reactive Pattern Implementation ✓
- [x] Make repository methods return Streams
- [x] Implement proper reactive pattern in base interfaces
  - [x] Update BaseRepository
  - [x] Update UserRepository
  - [x] Update UserRepositoryImpl
  - [x] Update BaseDataSource
  - [x] Update UserDataSource
  - [x] Update UserDataSourceImpl

### 2. Error Handling & Recovery ✓
- [x] Create specific error types
  - [x] Authentication errors
  - [x] User operation errors
  - [x] General operation errors
- [x] Implement error transformation
  - [x] DataSource layer
  - [x] Repository layer
- [x] Add retry mechanism with exponential backoff
  - [x] Create RetryConfig class
    ```dart
    class RetryConfig {
      final int maxAttempts;
      final Duration initialDelay;
      final Duration maxDelay;
      final double backoffFactor;
    }
    ```
  - [x] Implement retry logic in UserDataSourceImpl
  - [x] Add retry events for monitoring
  - [x] Configure retry policies per operation type

- [x] Implement circuit breaker pattern
  - [x] Create CircuitBreakerConfig
    ```dart
    class CircuitBreakerConfig {
      final int failureThreshold;
      final Duration resetTimeout;
      final int halfOpenMaxAttempts;
    }
    ```
  - [x] Implement circuit breaker state machine
  - [x] Add circuit breaker events
  - [x] Configure thresholds for user operations

### 3. Testing (Partially Complete)
- [x] Unit Tests
  - [x] Test retry mechanism
    - [x] Verify exponential backoff timing
    - [x] Test max attempts behavior
    - [x] Test successful retry scenarios
  - [x] Test circuit breaker
    - [x] Verify state transitions
    - [x] Test failure threshold
    - [x] Test reset behavior
- [x] Integration Tests
  - [x] Test end-to-end authentication flow
    - [x] Registration with intermittent failures
    - [x] Circuit breaker behavior
    - [x] Recovery after circuit opens
  - [x] Test token refresh with retries
  - [x] Test circuit breaker in real scenarios

### 4. Documentation (Not Started)
- [ ] Document retry mechanism
  - [ ] Configuration options
  - [ ] Best practices
  - [ ] Event handling
- [ ] Document circuit breaker
  - [ ] State machine explanation
  - [ ] Configuration guidelines
  - [ ] Monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Add architecture documentation
  - [ ] Update reactive-architecture.md with resilience patterns
  - [ ] Add configuration guidelines
  - [ ] Document event handling and monitoring

## Next Steps
1. [x] ~~Write integration tests for authentication flow~~
   - [x] ~~Test successful login/registration~~
   - [x] ~~Test token refresh scenarios~~
   - [x] ~~Test error recovery with retries~~
   - [x] ~~Test circuit breaker behavior~~

2. [ ] Add comprehensive documentation
   - [ ] Update reactive-architecture.md with resilience patterns
   - [ ] Add configuration guidelines
   - [ ] Document monitoring and alerting setup
   - [ ] Add examples of common scenarios and best practices

3. [ ] Add monitoring and observability
   - [ ] Add metrics collection for retry attempts
   - [ ] Add circuit breaker state monitoring
   - [ ] Create dashboard for resilience metrics
   - [ ] Set up alerts for degraded service states

## Notes
- ✓ Retry mechanism and circuit breaker are implemented and tested
- ✓ Integration tests are complete and passing
- → Focus next on documentation and monitoring
- → Consider adding metrics dashboard for monitoring
- → Plan for load testing to validate thresholds
