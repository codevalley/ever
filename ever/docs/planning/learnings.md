## Architectural Robustness During Feature Addition

### Issue: Breaking Core Functionality While Adding Features
**Date:** February 2024

#### Context
When adding task management features to an existing application with working authentication and note functionality, core features were inadvertently broken due to architectural changes.

#### Problem
During the addition of task support, several critical architectural components were simplified or removed:
1. Robust event handling with `BehaviorSubject` for state management
2. Dedicated token event handlers with proper retry logic
3. Proper state comparison and update mechanisms
4. Comprehensive subscription management

#### Root Cause
1. Focus on new feature implementation led to oversimplification of existing architecture
2. Core architectural components were modified without fully understanding their importance
3. Insufficient testing of existing functionality after adding new features

#### Solution
Before modifying architecture for new features:
1. Document and understand existing architectural patterns
2. Maintain critical components:
   - State management (`BehaviorSubject`)
   - Event handling (dedicated handlers)
   - Retry mechanisms
   - Subscription management
3. Extend rather than replace existing patterns

#### Key Learnings
1. "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" - maintain working architectural patterns
2. New features should extend architecture, not simplify it
3. Core functionality (auth, state management) requires special attention
4. Always test existing features after architectural changes
5. Document why architectural patterns exist before modifying them

#### Best Practices
1. Review existing architecture before adding features
2. Maintain separate concerns (auth, notes, tasks) in event handling
3. Keep robust error handling and retry mechanisms
4. Test core functionality after adding features
5. Document architectural decisions and their rationale
